Difference between JDK ,JRE and JVM

JDK : Java Development Kit
           
   Jdk consists of development tools to provide an environment to develop java programs and it also 
      consists of JRE to execute the program.
   By using Jdk we can develop and compile the program .
   
           

JRE : Java Run-Time Environment
           
   Jre consists of libraries and Jvm.
   It provides an environment to run a program. 
   It is the implementation of Jvm. 
   It contains set of libraries + other files that Jvm uses at runtime.

JVM : Java Virtual Machine 

   Jvm uses libraries from JRE to run the program .
   Jvm converts normal language code to machine language code.
   To execute a program in any platform JVM is needed.
   Jvm Loads the code ,Verifies the code, Executes the code.
   jvm reads and executes line by line
